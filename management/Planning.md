## Gantt Chart

Assign concrete tasks to each team member and plan your time using a Gantt Chart.

## Research state of the art projects

Go online and search for open source projects written in Python that do what your team want to do.


Complete this table one row for each project. You should list at least one project for each team member (i.e. you should research at four different projects if your team has four team members)

If you have difficulties finding projects similar to your project, search for different projects
but related (similar games, CRUD projects for different business, data analysis for different data, etc... ). You can also search for projects written in another language that you master.
